# Sorting With C

## Bubble sort
Simple sorting algorithom.Its best case time complexity is O(n^2)

## Quick sort
Inplace sorting algorithom.Its best case time complexity is n*log(n)

## Merge sort
Efficient sorting algorithom. Its best case time complexity is n*log(n)

## Insertion sort
Less efficient for large list. Its best case time complexity is n
